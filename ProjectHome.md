## Overview ##

Pigg Tools is a set of tools and utilities for working with .pigg archive files.  It is primarily developed using C#, with some external libraries used to provide auxiliary functionality such as DDS rendering and OGG decoding.  Pigg Tools is designed as an update and replacement for [PiggViewer](http://sourceforge.net/projects/piggviewer/), which appears to have been abandoned.

Pigg Tools is the basis for applications that allow client modifications for such purposes as extracting and customizing map files, badges, sounds, loading screens, etc. for games and/or applications that use the pigg file format.

## Current status ##

I have completed a lot of work on turning the front-end from a nominal testing harness for the back-end Pigg Interface class into an actual user-friendly GUI.

Currently, I am continuing work on making the front-end more friendly.  Also, I am working on implementing the ability to convert image files (.png, .bmp, etc.) into .texture files so that images can be modified.
